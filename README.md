# GameOfLife
This was the final project for my GUI programming course. Java programming language was used to design the GUI interface and program the logic of the game.

The file titled Game of Life.jar can be executed as is, and it will execute the Jar file and you can experience the game. All the other files are Java files which include the code for the game following MVC patterns.
